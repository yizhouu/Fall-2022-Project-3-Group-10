# Project: Weakly supervised learning-- label noise and correction


### [Full Project Description](doc/project3_desc.md)

Term: Fall 2022

+ Team 10
+ Team members
	+ team member 1 : Weilin Zhou
	+ team member 2 : Jiaxi Fang	
	+ team member 3 : Samira Kamal	
	+ team member 4 : Yizhou Zhao	

+ Project summary: In this project, we use CNN model for image classifications for noisy labels. CNN model is powerful in image processing, and we use it to create our own prediction model and improving its efficiency.
	
**Contribution statement**: 
- Yizhou presented, developed the entire project in Python, and created a unique model I which was selected as the group's model I based on the model's high performance. Jiaxi researched a collection of models including AlexNet. Samira also completed research and trained a collection of models for model 1 and 2 to assess performance. All team members participated in the computation for model evaluation.
